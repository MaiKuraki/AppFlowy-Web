## Investigate and analyze codebase

Perform investigation based on user request: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Steps

### 1. Gather Context

- Search codebase to understand requirements and existing implementation
- Map all dependencies, imports, and related modules
- Identify relevant functions, classes, structs, and type definitions
- Trace data flow and execution paths

### 2. Analysis & Planning

- Break down the request into discrete, actionable tasks
- Create sequence diagram showing component interactions and flow
- Document assumptions and edge cases
- Identify potential risks or breaking changes
- Consider backwards compatibility
