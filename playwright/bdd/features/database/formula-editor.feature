Feature: Formula editor
  The formula editor is where a formula is written: it opens from the type
  list, the property menu, a cell or the row page; it highlights the formula,
  suggests functions and properties, documents everything it offers, infers
  the result type, explains errors with their position and previews the
  result for a chosen row. Nothing is saved until the formula is committed.

  Background:
    Given a Grid for formula testing with these properties
      | property | type   | row 1 | row 2 | row 3   |
      | Name     | Text   | One   | Two   | <empty> |
      | Price    | Number | 12.5  | 4     | 0       |
      | Notes    | Text   | alpha | beta  | <empty> |

  # Opening the editor
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: Picking Formula from the new property type list opens the editor on an empty formula
    When I start a new formula property
    Then the formula editor is open with an empty formula
    And the formula editor title shows "Formula"
    And the formula editor infers type "empty"
    When I type the formula "prop("Price") * 2"
    Then the formula editor infers type "number"
    And the formula preview shows "25"
    And the formula editor shows no error
    When I close the formula editor with "the Done button"
    Then the formula "Formula" shows these values
      | 25 |
      | 8  |
      | 0  |

  Scenario: Switching an existing property to Formula opens the editor, picking Formula again does not
    When I switch the property "Notes" to "Formula"
    Then the formula editor is open with an empty formula
    And the formula editor title shows "Notes"
    When I type the formula "upper(prop("Name"))"
    And I close the formula editor with "the Done button"
    Then the formula "Notes" shows these values
      | ONE     |
      | TWO     |
      | <empty> |
    When I switch the property "Notes" to "Formula"
    Then the formula editor is closed

  Scenario: The property menu shows the saved formula and opens the editor
    Given a formula property "Double" with the expression "prop("Price") * 2"
    And a formula property "Blank" with the expression ""
    Then the property menu of "Blank" shows the formula item "Edit formula"
    And the property menu of "Double" shows the formula item "prop("Price") * 2"
    When I open the formula editor of "Double" from the property menu
    Then the formula editor title shows "Double"
    And the formula editor contains "prop("Price") * 2"

  Scenario: Clicking a formula cell opens the editor below the cell, previewing that row
    Given a formula property "Double" with the expression "prop("Price") * 2"

    And the formula preview shows "8"
    When I close the formula editor with "the Cancel button"
    Then the clicked cell is not selected

  Scenario: The editor opened from a cell discards or saves the draft like the dialog

    And I type the formula "prop("Price") * 100"
    And I close the formula editor with "a click outside"
    Then the clicked cell is not selected
    # Modal, like the dialog: clicking another cell only closes the editor.
    When I open the formula editor of "Double" by clicking its cell in row 2
    And I type the formula "prop("Price") * 100"
    And I click the formula cell of "Double" in row 1 while the editor is open

  # Catalogue and docs
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: The catalogue lists properties, built-ins and functions and can be searched
    Given a formula property "Double" with the expression "prop("Price") * 2"
    When I open the formula editor of "Double" from the property menu

  # Types, errors, preview
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scenario: The editor infers the result type while typing
    When I start a new formula property
    Then these formulas infer these types
      | expression                         | type       |
      | prop("Price") + 1                  | number     |
      | prop("Name") + "!"                 | text       |
      | prop("Price") > 1                  | boolean    |

      | "Due " + now()                     | text       |
      | prop("Name") - 1                   | any        |

  Scenario: The editor explains errors with their position
    When I start a new formula property
    Then these formulas show these errors
      | expression                  | error                                                             |
      | "a" - 1                     | "-" expects a number, got text [1,1]                              |

      | foo(1)                      | Unknown function "foo" [1,1]                                      |
      | prop("Nope")                | Unknown property "Nope" [1,1]                                     |
      | if(true, 1)                 | if() expects 3 arguments [1,1]                                    |
      | if(true, 1, "a")            | if() branches must have the same type: number vs text [1,13]      |
      | upper(prop("Price"))        | upper() expects text for "text", got number [1,7]                 |
      | 1 < 2 < 3                   | Comparisons cannot be chained; combine them with "and" [1,7]      |
      | "open                       | Unterminated string [1,1]                                         |
      | current                     | Unknown variable or function "current" [1,1]                      |
      | [1, 2].filter(current + 1)  | filter() expects a condition that returns a boolean [1,15]        |
    And the Done button is disabled

  Scenario: The preview follows the chosen row and shows empty results as a dash
    When I start a new formula property
    Then the preview row choices are
      | One   |
      | Two   |
      | Row 3 |
    When I type the formula "prop("Notes")"
    Then the formula preview shows "alpha"
    When I choose the preview row "Two"
    Then the formula preview shows "beta"
    When I choose the preview row "Row 3"
    Then the formula preview shows "—"
    When I type the formula "prop("Notes") +"
    Then the formula preview shows ""
